     <h1>Know the source !</h1>
     <h3><p>Check the products you buy and the companies you support to ensure that your
         buying habits are not contributing to destruction of habitat elsewhere. Look for 
         labels such as FSC or Rainforest Alliance Certified. Both organizations are committed 
         not only to the conservation of the Earth's resources, but also to advocating for the human
         rights of the native peoples who inhabit the land many products are sourced from.

         It wouldn't be a bad idea to do what a billionaire American did; buying patches of
         forest land and protecting it from people who want to cut it down! However, privatising
         natural spaces is not a palatable option for many. Nevertheless, it is possible
         to showcase natural land as important economic goods through Payment for Ecosystem Services
         (PES) systems. When money is at stake, perceptions change. It can create renewed interest
         in protecting land resources.
