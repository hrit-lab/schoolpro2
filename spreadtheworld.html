    <h3> Knowledge truly is power. The more you tell others about eco- friendly living and teach
        them how they can make a difference through sustainable practices, the more likely it is they
        will become concious of the choices they make as they come to understand the powerful effects
        that our behaviours and habits have on the Earth.
